# Task 2
# Identify and display the Ethernet interface characteristics:
# (a) Identify broadcast address
# (b) Identify all IP addresses which are part of the same subnet

ifconfig en0 | grep 'broadcast' | cut -d ' ' -f 6

# When you issue the “arp -a”, you’ll get IP-address-to-mac conversion and the allocation type 
# (whether dynamic or static) of all devices in your network.

arp -a
